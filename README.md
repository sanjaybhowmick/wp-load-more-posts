## WordPress Load more posts using Ajax without any plugin

*Step 1: Use the Default WordPress Loop*

In your theme's template file (e.g., index.php or archive.php), adjust the code to work with the default query:

*Step 2: JavaScript for AJAX (No Changes Needed) - ajax.js*

The JavaScript code remains the same. It will still handle the "Load More" button click and load the next set of posts.

*Step 3: Handle AJAX Request for Default Query*

In your functions.php file, update the AJAX handler to work with the default query:

*How It Works*

    Using the Default Query: The code now works with WordPress's default query, relying on the existing loop structure and using query_posts() in the AJAX handler to fetch the next set of posts.
    Load More Button: The button will still dynamically load posts as the user clicks, but it now works with the default query parameters set by WordPress, rather than a custom query.

This approach ensures you're using the default WordPress query while still enabling dynamic post loading with a "Load More" button.
